5.	DCL - (Grant, Revoke)
    DCL (Data Control Language) statements are used to control access (permissions/privileges) to the database.

Two main commands:
1.	GRANT → Give permission
2.	REVOKE → Take back permission

✅ 1. Creating Users

    -- Login as SYSDBA
    sqlplus / as sysdba;

    -- Create User
    create user USERNAME identified by password;

    -- Grant basic roles so user can connect and create objects
    grant connect, resource to USERNAME;

👉 CONNECT → lets the user log in – (Sql Developer Tool)
👉 RESOURCE → lets the user create tables, procedures, etc.

✅ 2. User01 Work (OWNER of the Table)

    -- Check current user
    select user from dual;

    -- Create table
    create table studentDetails (
    studId number,
    studName varchar2(50)
    );

    -- Insert sample rows
    insert into studentDetails values (101, 'Sara');
    insert into studentDetails values (102, 'Thara');
    insert into studentDetails values (103, 'Lara');

    -- View rows
    select * from studentDetails;

✅ 3. Granting Permissions to User02
    Suppose another user = STUDENTMANAGEMENT.
    User01 grants permission:

        grant select, insert, update, delete 
        on studentDetails 
        to STUDENTMANAGEMENT;

✅ 4. Actions from User02

    -- Check login
    select user from dual;

    -- Access User01’s table (must use schema.table)
    select * from USERNAME.studentDetails;

    -- Delete a row
    delete from USERNAME.studentDetails where studId = 103;
    commit;

    -- Verify deletion
    select * from USERNAME.studentDetails;

✅ 5. Revoke Privilege

    -- Now User01 removes DELETE privilege
    revoke delete on studentDetails from STUDENTMANAGEMENT;

✅ 6. Actions from User02 after Revoke

    -- Try deleting again
    delete from USERNAME.studentDetails where studId = 102;

✅ 7. Other Privileges You Can Grant

    •	SELECT → read rows
    •	INSERT → add new rows
    •	UPDATE → modify rows
    •	DELETE → remove rows
    •	REFERENCES → allow foreign key usage
    •	ALTER → change table definition
    •	INDEX → create indexes

✅ 8. Special Cases of GRANT/REVOKE

    (a)	Grant/Revoke ALL Privileges

        grant all on studentDetails to STUDENTMANAGEMENT;
        revoke all on studentDetails from STUDENTMANAGEMENT;

    (b)	Grant/Revoke for All Users (PUBLIC)

        grant all on studentDetails to public;
        revoke all on studentDetails from public;

    ⚠️ Be careful: PUBLIC = every user in the database.

    (c)	Role-based Privileges
    
        -- Create a role
        create role studentRole;

        -- Assign role to users
        grant studentRole to user01, user02, user03;

        -- Grant object privileges to role
        grant all on studentDetails to studentRole;

        -- Revoke privileges from role
        revoke all on studentDetails from studentRole;

    👉 This is how DBAs manage groups of users easily. Instead of granting to each user, they just manage roles.
