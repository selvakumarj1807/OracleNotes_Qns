4.	TCL - (Commit, Rollback, SavePoint)

1.	TCL statements are used to manage transactions in a database.
2.	A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that Oracle treats as a single unit of work.

âœ… 1. COMMIT
â€¢	Saves all changes made in the current transaction permanently into the database.
â€¢	Once committed, you cannot rollback those changes.

Example:
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id NUMBER,
    name VARCHAR2(100),
    age NUMBER
);

-- Insert a record
INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, 'Rahul', 21);

-- Save permanently
COMMIT;

ðŸ‘‰ Now the record is permanently stored in the database.

âœ… 2. ROLLBACK
    â€¢	Reverts changes made during the current transaction.
    â€¢	If you havenâ€™t used COMMIT, you can undo changes with ROLLBACK.

Example:
-- Insert another record
INSERT INTO students VALUES (2, 'Sneha', 20);

-- Oops, wrong insert â†’ Undo it
ROLLBACK;

âœ… 3. SAVEPOINTs
    â€¢	Creates a temporary marker within a transaction.
    â€¢	You can roll back to a specific savepoint instead of rolling back the entire transaction.

Example:
-- Insert multiple students
INSERT INTO students VALUES (3, 'Amit', 22);
SAVEPOINT sp1;   -- Savepoint created

INSERT INTO students VALUES (4, 'Priya', 19);
SAVEPOINT sp2;   -- Another savepoint created

INSERT INTO students VALUES (5, 'Ramesh', 23);

-- Rollback only to savepoint sp2
ROLLBACK TO sp2;

COMMIT;

ðŸ‘‰ After this:
    â€¢	Record with student_id = 3 (Amit) is saved.
    â€¢	Record with student_id = 4 (Priya) is saved.
    â€¢	Record with student_id = 5 (Ramesh) is removed because rollback went to sp2.

âš¡ Key Notes
    â€¢	DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE) require TCL (COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT) to confirm or undo.
    â€¢	DDL (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE) statements auto-commit â†’ you cannot rollback them.
