1. COMMIT â€“ Single Transaction

You inserted 3 student records into the students table. The interviewer asks:
ðŸ‘‰ At what point will these records become permanently available to other users â€“ before or after COMMIT?

2. COMMIT â€“ Banking Example

A bank transfer transaction debits â‚¹5000 from Account A and credits â‚¹5000 to Account B.
ðŸ‘‰ Why is it important to use COMMIT only after both operations succeed?

3. ROLLBACK â€“ Undo Wrong Insert

You inserted a wrong student record (id=10, name='XYZ', age=99).
ðŸ‘‰ Which TCL command would you use to remove this record before it is saved permanently?

4. ROLLBACK â€“ Multiple DML Statements

You executed 5 INSERT statements in sequence but realized the 3rd one was incorrect.
ðŸ‘‰ If you havenâ€™t committed yet, what will happen if you use a plain ROLLBACK?

5. SAVEPOINT â€“ Partial Rollback

You insert 3 student records:

    â€¢ After 1st insert â†’ Create Savepoint A

    â€¢ After 2nd insert â†’ Create Savepoint B

    â€¢ After 3rd insert â†’ No savepoint

ðŸ‘‰ If you ROLLBACK TO Savepoint B, which records will remain and which will be undone?

6. SAVEPOINT â€“ Update + Rollback

You updated the age of all students to +1. Then you created a savepoint. After that, you updated the name of one student incorrectly.
ðŸ‘‰ How would you revert only the last update while keeping the age changes?

7. COMMIT vs. ROLLBACK

You delete all students below age 18, but before committing, your manager tells you this was a mistake.
ðŸ‘‰ What TCL command will restore the deleted rows?

8. Implicit COMMIT

You created a new table student_backup using CREATE TABLE.
ðŸ‘‰ Why canâ€™t you rollback this operation?

9. Real-Life Transaction

In an online shopping system, a user places an order. The transaction includes:

    â€¢ Deducting money from wallet

    â€¢ Reducing product stock

    â€¢ Inserting order details

ðŸ‘‰ What will happen if the stock update fails but you already committed the wallet deduction?

10. Multiple Savepoints

You run these operations:

    â€¢ Insert record A â†’ SAVEPOINT sp1

    â€¢ Insert record B â†’ SAVEPOINT sp2

    â€¢ Insert record C â†’ SAVEPOINT sp3

ðŸ‘‰ If you ROLLBACK TO sp1 and then COMMIT, which records remain in the database?
