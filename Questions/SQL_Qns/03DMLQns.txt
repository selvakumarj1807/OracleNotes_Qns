Questions:
----------

1. **INSERT** â€“ A new student named *Arjun* (age 18) joins the college.
   ðŸ‘‰ How would you insert his record into the `students` table?

2. **INSERT (Partial Columns)** â€“ You only know the `student_id = 8` and `name = "Pooja"`, age is not yet available.
   ðŸ‘‰ How would you insert this record?

3. **Multiple INSERTS** â€“ Insert 2 students in a single query: `(9, 'Sahil', 22)` and `(10, 'Anita', 20)`.
   ðŸ‘‰ How would you do this?

4. **UPDATE (Single Student)** â€“ Update Rameshâ€™s name (`student_id = 5`) to "Ramesh Kumar".
   ðŸ‘‰ How would you update his record?

5. **UPDATE (All Students)** â€“ Increase the age of every student by 1 year.
   ðŸ‘‰ Write the query.

6. **DELETE (Single Student)** â€“ Remove Priya (`student_id = 4`) from the `students` table.
   ðŸ‘‰ Write the query.

7. **DELETE (Multiple Students)** â€“ Remove all students whose age is exactly 20.
   ðŸ‘‰ Write the query.

8. **MERGE (Upsert)** â€“ Sync data from `students_new` to `students`:

   * If a student exists, update their name & age.
   * If not, insert them.
     ðŸ‘‰ Write the `MERGE` query.

9. **MERGE (Insert Only If Not Exists)** â€“ From `students_new`, insert students into `students` only if they donâ€™t already exist.
   ðŸ‘‰ Write the `MERGE` query.

10. **MERGE (Update Only If Exists)** â€“ From `students_new`, update the existing students in `students`, but do not insert new ones.
    ðŸ‘‰ Write the `MERGE` query.
